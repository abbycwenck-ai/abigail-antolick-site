          <h2>The marketer who refused to wait.</h2>
          <p>I started my career as an Operations Analyst at Kforce, where I led the implementation of a CRM (Dynamics 365) that helped bring in $25 million in revenue. That's where I fell in love with the intersection of marketing, operations, and data.</p>
          <p>From there I went to Agora Financial, where I managed a production team of designers and developers, ran a 24-hour product launch that earned $1.4M in revenue, and led operations for a $2M/year financial product. I learned how to move fast, manage teams, and drive real revenue.</p>
          <p>Then I spent over 4 years at Mindful Health Life, rising from Operations Project Manager to Director of Marketing Operations — where I strategized and executed marketing across 3 brands (Earth Echo Foods, FitRise, and Haseya) driving $10M+ in annual revenue. I grew the Haseya brand from $0 to $400K in one year. I built 50+ sales pages in Shopify. I launched 6,000+ qualified leads at $3.50 CPL.</p>
          <p>Now I'm the Marketing Operations Director at The Funk'tional Nutritionist, where I've already orchestrated the highest-grossing revenue quarter in company history, increased client volume by 43%, and led a full CRM migration to build attribution dashboards from scratch.</p>
          <p><strong>No agency overhead. No developer invoices. No waiting. Just strategy, dashboards, and results.</strong></p>

        <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
        <p class="philosophy__quote">"Marketing without data is just <span>guessing with a budget.</span> I give startups the strategy AND the visibility to know exactly where every dollar goes."</p>
        <p>I work exclusively with startups at $10M and under because that's where every marketing dollar matters most. You can't afford to waste money on channels that aren't working — and you shouldn't have to hire a full analytics team to figure that out.</p>

          <h2>Beyond the dashboards.</h2>
          <p>I'm a Towson University grad (B.S. in Business Administration), a Certified ScrumMaster, and someone who genuinely gets excited about CRM migrations and attribution modeling. I live in Darlington, MD, and I work remotely with brands across the country.</p>
          <p>I'm a millennial who remembers when "social media marketing" meant having a Facebook page. I've watched this industry evolve and I've evolved with it — from Shopify and ClickBank to GoHighLevel and Klaviyo, from Looker Studio to DOMO to Wicked Reports. I'm always learning, always building, always questioning whether the way we've always done things is still the best way.</p>
          <p>I believe the best marketing feels honest. Not salesy, not gimmicky — just clear communication about real value. That's what I bring to every client relationship.</p>
